\begin{abstract}
My study presents a comparative analysis between CNNs (ResNet-50) and Vision Transformers (ViT-Base) for the classification of dermatoscopic images from the HAM10000 dataset.
Utilizing MPS (Metal Performance Shaders acceleration on an apple M4 chip, and it managed to process (on GPU power) 10015 iamges in approximately 17 minutes.
The results indicate that ResNet-50 acheived a superior tarining loss of 0.6002 compared to 0.9884 for the ViT-Base model.
the results suggest that the ResNet-50 provides a significant advantage in convergence speed and accuracy for specialized medical imaging tasks.
