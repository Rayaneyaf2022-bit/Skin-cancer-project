\section{Introduction}
Automated classification of skin lesions is an extremely important task in dermatology, where early detection of tumors such as melanoma can significantly improve patient outcomes.
Traditional deep learning approaches have relied heavily on CNNs like ResNet-50, which excel at capturing local spatial patterns through inductive biases.
However, the recent emergence of Vision Transformers has challenged this standard by utilizing self attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across image patches.

In this project, i evaluated these two architectures using the HAM10000 dataset with a large scale collection of dermatoscopic images.
The key focus of my study is the feasibility of training these complex models on consumer grade hardware.
By leveraging the M4 chip's MPS, i helped show that high performance medical image classification is possible outside of traditional server environment by providing a benchmark for local diagnostic tools.
