\section{Conclusion}
In this project, i successfully implemented and compared ResNet-50 and ViT-Base for skin lesion classification.
Using the Apple M4 chip and MPS acceleration, i helped show that deep learning on 10,015 images is highly efficient on modern consumer hardware, completing the training in 19 minutes.

The results confirm that for this specific dataset and training duration, the ResNet-50 model is superior, achieving a training loss of 0.6002.
While the Vision Transformer shows promise, it requires more intensive training to match the performance of convolutional models in medical imaging.
Future work could involve extending the number of epochs and implementing data augmentation to further bridge the performance gap.
