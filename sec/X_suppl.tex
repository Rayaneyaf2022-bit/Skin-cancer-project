\section{Supplementary Material}

In this section,i provided additional visual evidence and interpretability analysis to support the findings in the main report.
These materials demonstrate the technical feasibility and result integrity of our experiments on the M4 silicon.

\subsection{Model Interpretability: Attention Maps}

To understand how the ResNet-50 and the ViT distinguish between different skin lesions, i generated attention maps using the code provided in the open-source repository.

\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:attention_map}, the model successfully localizes the lesion without being distracted by background noise or skin texture.
This interpretability is crucial for medical applications to ensure result integrity and trust in AI assisted diagnosis.

\subsection{Hardware Performance Demo}

This demo showcases the real time utilization of the \textbf{Apple M4 GPU} via the \textit{MPS} backend. It demonstrates:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rapid data loading from the HAM10000 dataset.
    \item Real-time loss reduction during the 1-epoch benchmark.
    \item GPU memory efficiency on the local M4 chip.
\end{itemize}
